This is a small tool for focusing and propagating light in anisotropic stratified media.
It includes a class `Spectrum` for representing real and angular spectra of light. This
spectrum can be focused, using the approach of Richards and Wolf [1]_.

`Materials` can be defined in a class of this name and solved for modes defined by the
tangential components of the wave vector. A stratified medium of the materials is
defined in a `Stack`, which can be solved using the solutions in the material and
including interface conditions. This part mainly follows the method of Yeh [2]_.

A spectrum can be propagated through a stack returning the field at arbitrary positions.
